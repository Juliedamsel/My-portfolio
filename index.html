            <h2>My Coding Journey</h2>
            <p>
                My journey started with a simple curiosity. I dabbled in HTML and CSS, making small 
                changes to websites and experiencing the joy of seeing those changes come to life. 
                That's when I realized my passion for frontend development.
                As I delved deeper, My quest to know more increase and that was the point I joined Aspilos foundation where I explored more practicals
                on HTML, CSS and JavaScript and its many frameworks, gradually building a strong foundation. There were challenges along the way, but they were all part of the fun.
            </p>

            <p>
                The true excitement came when I started working on real projects. 
                From creating interactive web pages to developing responsive designs, I was able to apply what I had learned and watch my skills grow.
                Frontend development has taught me the art of problem-solving. Every bug or issue is an opportunity to learn something new. I've come to embrace challenges as a chance to improve.
                One of the most rewarding aspects of this journey has been connecting with the vibrant developer community.
                I'm only at the beginning of my journey, and the possibilities in frontend development are endless. I'm eager to keep pushing boundaries, exploring new technologies, 
                and creating beautiful and user-friendly web experiences.

            <h3>How I started Blogging</h3>
            <p>
                As I began my journey into the world of frontend development, I quickly realized that learning and growth go hand in hand. 
                The more I delved into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the more I wanted to share my experiences and discoveries with others.
                The idea of starting a blog emerged as a way to document my learning process. It was a way to reflect on my own progress, solidify my understanding of concepts, and perhaps help fellow developers who were on a similar learning path. 
                I was thrilled by the prospect of giving back to the community that had already taught me so much.
                I vividly remember writing my first blog post on my linkedln page. It was a simple tutorial on creating a basic HTML and CSS webpage. I aimed to make it beginner-friendly, 
                breaking down complex concepts into manageable steps. The sense of accomplishment after hitting that "post" button was indescribable.
                With each subsequent post, I shared more insights into my journey. I wrote about the challenges I faced, the resources I found most helpful, and the projects I was working on. Blogging became a platform to discuss not only my successes but also my struggles, as I believed that transparency in learning could inspire others.
